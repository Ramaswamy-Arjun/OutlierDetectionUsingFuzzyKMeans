Plastic pollution is a dangerous issue with long term hazardous effects on the environment and the health of human beings. Understanding and identifying the genes involved in plastic degradation can contribute to mediating the ill-effects of plastic pollution. The goal of this project is to provide a sophisticated computational framework for gene sequence analysis with the purpose of comprehending the pathways involved in the degradation of plastic. To improve the precision and effectiveness of gene sequence analysis for plastic degradation, we proposed a framework that combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural networks with Position-Specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST). After careful analysis, we put together a thorough knowledge graph that illustrates the connections between genes and their functions in the breakdown of plastic.
